confluence editing tool.

=== why?? ===

I use confluence every now and then when I'm working in an enterprise
company. It's about the best corporate wiki. That bar isn't very high.

I really hate the way they've taken wiki text away and made you use
HTML as the markup language.

This fixes that problem (by translating the XML back into Wiki) and
makes editing somewhat trivial.

=== status? ===

Still very experimental right now.

I'd love help!
